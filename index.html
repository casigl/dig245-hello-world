<p><em><span>Why are you taking this course?</span></em>
  <ul>
  <li>I am taking this course beacuase I am interesed in exploring more of the creative side of computer science. I enjoy making art and music projects.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p><em><span>What experience do you have creating content for the web or programming?</span></em>
  <span>
  <ul>
  <li>I took a class last semester with Dr. Peck in the Computer Science department called Data Vizualization. I co-created a website which exposes the large demographic inequity in Broadway musicals. <em><a href="https://www.arielcsc362.com.arielurimchung.com/">Link Here</a></em></li>
  </ul>
</span>
</p>

<p><em><span>What are your goals in this course?</span></em>
  <ul>
  <li>I would like to build on my HTML/CSS skills and challenege myself to actually bring my creative project ideas to life.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><em><span>Learn Computing Activity</span></em>
  <ul>
  <li> In this activity, we focused on learning about the command line. The command line allows users to communicate with the computer's operating system via text commands. We started practicing with the command <em>whoami</em>, which returns the username of the current user, i.e. carolinesigl. Then, we tried <em>pwd</em> to show the path of the current directory and ls which lists all the files within the current directory. Next, we created a file called hello.txt and viewed it within our current directory using the <em>touch</em> and <em>ls</em> commands. Then, we added text into our file using <em>echo</em> and viewed our edits using <em>cat</em>.  We then pinged the Davidson College website which allowed us to see the package communication speeds. Lastly, we used the <em>ls -l</em> command to see the dates of modification on our files and <em>open .</em> to view our current directory in Finder. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><em><span> Website Projects of Interest</span></em>
  <ul>
  <li>
    <em><a href="https://pudding.cool/2020/12/judge-my-spotify/">How Bad is Your Spotify?</a></em> This website analyzes your Spotify account and produces an interactive (and sarcastic) review of your music taste. I like to show this website to my friends because it pokes fun at something most people tend to be pretentious about. I also find it is clever how the website is designed to look like you are chatting back and forth with a human-like robot.
</li>
<li>
  <em><a href="https://www.billtjonesai.com/?experiments">Body Movement Language</a></em> This web project meshes together dance and speech recognition AI in a playful manner. There are a few different modes you can try to manipulate speech based text with movement. Although I am not a dancer, I found the performances and idea behind this project very compelling.
</li>
<li>
  <em><a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/columns/poetry-rx/">Poetry Rx</a></em> This blog archive is run by three poets who 'prescribe' poems to people who write in with personal dilemmas. I am interested in writing poetry and have enjoyed reading this column for a while now. Sadly, it has been put on pause lately, but hopefully it will get revived sometime soon.
